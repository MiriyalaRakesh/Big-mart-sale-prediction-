## 📖 About the Project

This project aims to solve a real-world business problem: **predicting the sales of items in a retail store chain**. By using historical sales data and product attributes, we build a machine learning model that can predict future sales for better planning and inventory management.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict the sales of products at different Big Mart stores using machine learning.
- Improve business decision-making for supply chain optimization.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

- Source: Provided CSV dataset (train/test)
- Contains information on:
  - Product details (e.g., type, weight, fat content)
  - Outlet details (e.g., location, type, size)
  - Historical sales data

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – preprocessing, model evaluation
  - `xgboost` – model training

---

## 🔬 ML Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values in `Item_Weight`, `Outlet_Size`
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Label encoded categorical variables (e.g., `Item_Fat_Content`)
3. **Train-Test Split**
   - Used `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`
4. **Model Training**
   - XGBoost Regressor for performance and accuracy
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: R² Score, RMSE

---

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric        | Value        |
|---------------|--------------|
| R² Score      | 0.56–0.62*   |
| RMSE          | ~1100–1300*  |

\*Values may vary depending on tuning and preprocessing.
